**What is Pay with Payeer for WooCommerce**

Payeer is a kind of online wallet where you can hold Crypto currencies along with FIAT currencies.

It also allows you to accept online payments thanks to the Payeer API. Thanks to our Payeer for WooCommerce plugin, you can start accepting payments via Payeer by simply entering your store ID and secret key.

### How to use

* Your Payeer details. Just enter the Merchant (Store) id and secret key in the payment gateways settings as follows.
