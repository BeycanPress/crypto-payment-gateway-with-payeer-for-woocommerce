### Crypto Payment Gateway with Payeer for WooCommerce

Payeer is a very popular service, especially in Russia, which you can use as a wallet for both FIAT coins and cryptocurrencies. We use Payeer in many of our subsidiaries and that's why we developed this service as a WooCommerce payment gateway for WordPress and WooCommerce users to receive crypto payments.

However, if you want to accept web3 cryptocurrency payments in general without being tied to a platform, you can also use our CryptoPay plugin for this.

### How to use

As you can see in the settings in the screenshots, as soon as you enter your merchant id and secret key, you can start using Payeer and accept crypto payments in your WooCommerce store.
